I need you to generate a complete, fully functional Flask application with an interactive web front end that meets the following requirements:

1. **Grid Generation**  
   - The application should allow the user to specify a grid size \(n\) (where \(n\) is between 3 and 7).
   - The backend will randomly generate an \(n \times n\) grid that includes:
     - **1 Start Cell:** Marked as "start" and displayed in green.
     - **1 Goal Cell:** Marked as "goal" and displayed in red. Reaching this cell yields a reward of +20 and is a terminal state.
     - **1 Dead Cell:** Marked as "dead" and displayed in blue. Entering this cell yields a penalty of –20 and is a terminal state.
     - **2 Obstacle Cells:** Marked as "obstacle" and displayed in gray. Obstacles are impassable.
     - All other cells are "empty" (i.e., normal path with a white background).

2. **User Interaction**  
   - On the webpage, the grid should be displayed. There should also be radio buttons that let the user select one of the following modes:
     - Set Start Cell
     - Set Goal Cell
     - Set Dead Cell
     - Place Obstacle
   - When the user clicks a cell, the application should update that cell’s state according to the selected mode.
   - **Special Modification:** If the user is in the “dead” mode or “obstacle” mode and clicks on a cell that is already a dead cell or an obstacle cell respectively, that cell should revert back to an "empty" cell (i.e., it should toggle off the special state).

3. **Value Iteration Algorithm**  
   - The application should include a "Run Value Iteration" button. When pressed, the backend should run a value iteration algorithm over the grid.
   - The value iteration should consider:
     - Moving from an "empty" cell costs -1.
     - Moving into a "goal" cell yields a reward of +20 and is terminal.
     - Moving into a "dead" cell yields a penalty of –20 and is terminal.
     - Obstacles are impassable (treated like walls) so that if an action would lead into an obstacle or out-of-bounds, the agent remains in the same cell and receives a -1 reward.
     - The algorithm is deterministic and considers the four directions: up, down, left, right.
   - The algorithm should compute, for each cell (except obstacles and terminal cells), the optimal action (policy) and the corresponding value \(V(s)\).
   - Once computed, the web interface should update each grid cell to show the optimal action (as an arrow or symbol) and the value (formatted as a decimal) for that cell.

4. **Code Structure**  
   - The Flask backend should contain:
     - A route to render the main page (with the input for \(n\)).
     - A route to generate the grid randomly based on the provided \(n\).
     - A route (e.g., `/update_cell`) that handles AJAX POST requests when a cell is clicked. This route should update the cell’s state accordingly.  
       *Note:* For modes “dead” and “obstacle”, if the cell clicked is already a dead cell or an obstacle cell, it should be reverted to "empty".
     - A route (e.g., `/value_iteration`) that executes the value iteration algorithm and returns the computed policy and value function as JSON.
   - The frontend should be written in HTML/CSS with JavaScript to:
     - Display the grid.
     - Allow the user to select modes via radio buttons.
     - Send AJAX requests to update cell states and run value iteration.
     - Update the display to show current cell states, and after value iteration, update each cell to show both the optimal action and the computed value.

Please generate the full code for this application including:
- The Flask backend code (e.g., in a file named `app.py`).
- The HTML template (e.g., `templates/index.html`) that contains the front-end code.
- Ensure that the `/update_cell` endpoint implements the functionality so that if a cell already marked as "dead" or "obstacle" is clicked (while in the respective mode), it toggles that cell back to "empty".

# Grid World Value Iteration Application

This project is an interactive web application built with Flask that simulates a grid world environment. It demonstrates the use of a value iteration algorithm to compute the optimal policy for an agent navigating a grid with various cell types (start, goal, dead, obstacle, and empty). The application allows users to generate a grid of customizable size (3x3 to 7x7), view a randomly generated layout with pre-assigned special cells, manually update cell states, and run a value iteration algorithm to compute and display the optimal actions and value function for each cell.

The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. Below is a detailed introduction to each step.

---

## CRISP-DM Process Overview

### 1. Business Understanding
- **Objective:**  
  The goal is to create an interactive demonstration of a value iteration algorithm—a key method in reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. The application simulates a grid world where an agent starts at a specified cell and seeks to reach a goal cell while avoiding dead cells and obstacles.
- **Business Value:**  
  This application serves as an educational tool that visually explains how optimal policies are derived in a controlled environment. It is useful for teaching, research, and prototyping reinforcement learning techniques.

### 2. Data Understanding
- **Data Components:**  
  The "data" in this project is the grid itself, which is represented as an \( n \times n \) matrix. Each cell in the grid can have one of the following states:
  - **Empty:** A normal cell representing a navigable path.
  - **Start:** The starting point (displayed in green).
  - **Goal:** The target cell that yields a reward of +20 when reached (displayed in red and terminal).
  - **Dead:** A cell that incurs a penalty of –20 when entered (displayed in blue and terminal).
  - **Obstacle:** Impassable cells that block movement (displayed in gray).
- **Data Sources:**  
  The grid is generated based on user input for \( n \) (between 3 and 7) and is randomized to assign the special cells (start, goal, dead, and obstacles). User interactions further modify this dataset.

### 3. Data Preparation
- **Grid Initialization:**  
  - The backend randomly creates an \( n \times n \) grid.
  - Special cells are randomly assigned:
    - **1 Start Cell**
    - **1 Goal Cell**
    - **1 Dead Cell**
    - **2 Obstacle Cells**
  - All other cells are marked as empty.
- **User Interaction:**  
  - Users can update the grid by clicking cells to change their state (using modes: start, goal, dead, obstacle).
  - **Toggle Functionality:**  
    When a user clicks on a cell that is already marked as a dead cell or an obstacle (while in the respective mode), the cell toggles back to "empty", effectively restoring it as a path.

### 4. Modeling
- **Value Iteration Algorithm:**  
  - **Goal:** Compute the optimal value function \( V(s) \) for each cell and derive the best action (policy) using the Bellman optimality equation.
  - **Assumptions:**  
    - Moving from an empty cell has a cost of \(-1\).
    - Entering the goal cell gives a reward of \(+20\) and is terminal.
    - Entering the dead cell results in a penalty of \(-20\) and is terminal.
    - Obstacles are impassable; attempting to move into an obstacle or out-of-bound cell keeps the agent in place with a cost of \(-1\).
  - **Algorithm Steps:**
    1. **Initialization:**  
       Initialize the value function for all cells (with fixed values for goal, dead, and obstacles).
    2. **Iteration:**  
       Iteratively update the value of each cell using the Bellman equation:
       \[
       V(s) = \max_{a} \left[ R(s,a) + \gamma \, V(s') \right]
       \]
       until the values converge.
    3. **Policy Extraction:**  
       For each cell (except obstacles and terminal cells), choose the action that maximizes the expected value.
- **Outcome:**  
  The computed optimal actions (policy) and values are then displayed on the grid.

### 5. Evaluation
- **Visual Evaluation:**  
  - The web interface displays the grid, including the computed optimal actions (arrows or symbols) and value function for each cell.
  - Users can observe if the value iteration algorithm correctly identifies the best paths from the start cell to the goal cell while avoiding dead cells and obstacles.
- **Testing:**  
  - Multiple grid configurations can be generated and manipulated to test the robustness and correctness of the algorithm.
  - The interactive nature of the application allows for immediate visual feedback.

### 6. Deployment
- **Web Application:**  
  The final solution is deployed as a Flask web application.
- **Frontend:**  
  - The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - AJAX is used to communicate with the Flask backend for grid generation, cell updates, and running the value iteration algorithm.
- **Hosting:**  
  The application can be hosted on any server that supports Flask, making it accessible via a web browser.
