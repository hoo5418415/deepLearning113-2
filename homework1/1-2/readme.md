I need you to generate a complete Python Flask web application with Tkinter integration that meets the following specifications. Please provide detailed, commented code for both `app.py` and `templates/index.html` in Markdown format. The application should compute the value function using **iterative policy evaluation** under a uniform random policy, but it must **not calculate or update values for obstacle cells** (their value should remain fixed at 0 and their policy should be represented as "#").

### Requirements:

1. **Web Interface & Grid Generation:**
   - The web page should initially show only a form to enter the grid size (an integer between 5 and 9). No grid should be displayed on the GET request.
   - When the user submits the form (via a POST request to `/`), the server must generate an n×n grid where:
     - The starting cell is fixed at (0, 0) and is displayed in green.
     - A goal cell is randomly chosen from the remaining positions and is displayed in red.
     - A dead cell is also randomly chosen from the remaining positions and is displayed in blue.
     - The grid should include exactly n-2 obstacle cells randomly chosen from the remaining positions, and these should be displayed in gray.
   - The generated grid configuration (n, start, goal, dead, and obstacles) should be stored in the Flask session and then rendered on the web page.

2. **Iterative Policy Evaluation & Policy Derivation:**
   - Create a `/solve` route that is invoked by a "Show Results" button on the web page.
   - When `/solve` is called, retrieve the grid configuration from the session.
   - Compute the value function using **iterative policy evaluation** with the following settings:
     - Use a uniform random policy over four actions: up ("U"), down ("D"), left ("L"), and right ("R").
     - The reward settings are: +20 for reaching the goal, –20 for reaching the dead cell, –1 penalty for attempting to move into an obstacle (in which case the agent stays in place), and a step cost of –0.1 for normal moves.
     - **Important:** For any cell that is an obstacle, its value should not be updated (it remains 0).
   - Derive a greedy policy (one-step improvement) from the computed value function, again skipping obstacles (i.e., obstacles should have their policy set to "#").

3. **Tkinter Integration:**
   - After computing the value function and deriving the policy, open a Tkinter window (a modal, blocking window) that displays:
     - The Value Matrix (with each cell's value formatted to two decimal places) in one panel.
     - The Policy Matrix (with appropriate arrows for actions and special symbols for terminal/obstacle states) in another panel.
   - When the Tkinter window is closed, the web page should re-render the grid (i.e., the user stays on the grid page, and the page does not redirect elsewhere).

4. **Code Organization:**
   - The project should have the following structure:
     ```
     your_project/
     ├── app.py
     └── templates/
         └── index.html
     ```
   - `app.py` should contain all the Flask routes, the iterative policy evaluation logic, policy derivation, and the Tkinter code.
   - `templates/index.html` should include HTML and CSS to display the grid, with the following classes:
     - `.start` for the starting cell (green)
     - `.goal` for the goal cell (red)
     - `.dead` for the dead cell (blue)
     - `.obstacle` for obstacles (gray)

5. **Comments and Explanations:**
   - Include comments throughout the code to explain what each part does.
   - Provide a brief explanation for the iterative policy evaluation process, and note that obstacles are excluded from updates.

### Expected Output:
- When the application is run, the user visits the homepage (GET request) and sees only the form.
- After submitting a grid size (between 5 and 9), the generated grid is shown on the webpage.
- A "Show Results" button appears below the grid.
- When "Show Results" is clicked, the `/solve` route is triggered. The value function is computed (obstacle cells remain at 0), a greedy policy is derived, and a Tkinter window pops up showing the Value Matrix and Policy Matrix.
- Once the Tkinter window is closed, the web page continues to display the grid without redirecting.

Please generate the complete code for `app.py` and `templates/index.html` that meets all the above requirements.

# Reinforcement Learning Gridworld with Iterative Policy Evaluation

This project demonstrates an interactive gridworld simulation using Flask for the web interface and Tkinter for local visualization. The gridworld is used to illustrate basic reinforcement learning concepts by computing the value function via iterative policy evaluation under a uniform random policy. In this implementation, obstacle cells are excluded from the evaluation (their value remains fixed at 0).

This project is structured following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. Below is a detailed explanation of each CRISP-DM phase as it applies to this project.

---

## 1. Business Understanding

**Objective:**  
- Develop an educational tool to demonstrate reinforcement learning (RL) concepts in a gridworld environment.
- Allow users to interactively generate a grid (size between 5×5 and 9×9) where specific cells are assigned roles:
  - **Start cell:** fixed at (0,0) (green).
  - **Goal cell:** randomly chosen (red), yielding a reward of +20.
  - **Dead cell:** randomly chosen (blue), yielding a penalty of –20.
  - **Obstacle cells:** randomly chosen (n-2 cells, gray); these cells are not updated during value computation.
- Compute a value function using **iterative policy evaluation** (under a uniform random policy) while excluding obstacle cells.
- Derive a greedy policy based on the computed value function.
- Display both the Value Matrix and Policy Matrix in a Tkinter window for local visualization.

**Benefits:**  
- Provides an intuitive understanding of RL value computation.
- Demonstrates how iterative policy evaluation works.
- Bridges web-based interaction (Flask) with desktop visualization (Tkinter).

---

## 2. Data Understanding

**Data Components:**  
- **Grid Cells:** Each cell represents a state.
- **Start, Goal, and Dead Cells:** Special cells with predefined rewards.
- **Obstacles:** Cells that are fixed (value remains 0) and are not updated during evaluation.
- **Action Space:** Four possible actions (Up, Down, Left, Right).

**Characteristics:**  
- The grid is generated dynamically based on user input (size between 5 and 9).
- Reward structure:
  - Goal: +20
  - Dead: –20
  - Obstacles: –1 if an action attempts to move into an obstacle (agent remains in place)
  - Normal moves: step cost of –0.1

---

## 3. Data Preparation

**Steps:**  
- **User Input Validation:** The grid size is input via a web form and validated to ensure it is between 5 and 9.
- **Grid Generation:**  
  - The start cell is fixed at (0,0).
  - The goal and dead cells are chosen randomly from the remaining positions.
  - Exactly n-2 obstacle cells are randomly selected from the remaining positions.
- **Session Storage:**  
  - The grid configuration (n, start, goal, dead, obstacles) is stored in the Flask session to be reused during evaluation.

**Purpose:**  
- To ensure that the gridworld is consistently and correctly generated for the subsequent RL evaluation.

## 4. Modeling

**Approach:**  
- **Iterative Policy Evaluation:**  
  - Evaluate the value function under a uniform random policy.
  - For each non-terminal and non-obstacle state, update its value based on the expected reward for each action.
  - Terminal states (goal and dead) have fixed values.
  - **Obstacles are excluded from the computation:** Their value remains fixed at 0, and they are marked with a special symbol in the policy.
  
**Process:**  
1. **Initialization:** Set all state values to 0.
2. **Evaluation Loop:**  
   - For each non-terminal, non-obstacle state, update the value by averaging over the rewards (with discount factor γ) for all four possible actions.
   - Continue iterating until the maximum change (delta) is less than a predefined threshold (θ).
3. **Policy Derivation:**  
   - Derive a greedy policy by selecting the action that maximizes the expected return for each state.
   - For obstacle cells, the policy is set to a special symbol (e.g., "#").

## 5. Evaluation

**Methods:**  
- **Visual Inspection:**  
  - The resulting Value Matrix (each value formatted to two decimal places) and Policy Matrix (with arrows for actions and special symbols for terminal/obstacle cells) are displayed in a Tkinter window.
- **Convergence Check:**  
  - The iterative policy evaluation loop continues until convergence (delta < θ), ensuring a stable solution.
  
**Insights:**  
- By examining the matrices, users can verify the effectiveness of the evaluation.
- The exclusion of obstacle cells from computation demonstrates how state constraints can be integrated into RL algorithms.

## 6. Deployment

**Deployment Details:**  
- **Flask Web Application:**  
  - Provides the user interface for grid size input and grid generation.
  - Stores grid configuration in a session.
- **Tkinter Visualization:**  
  - When the "Show Results" button is pressed, the RL evaluation is triggered.
  - A Tkinter window pops up, displaying the Value Matrix and Policy Matrix.
  - The Tkinter window is modal; when closed, the user remains on the same grid page in the browser.
  
**Project Structure:**
