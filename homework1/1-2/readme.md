I need you to generate a corrected version of an HTML template file (named `index.html`) for a Flask web application. The purpose of this template is to display a generated grid and, if available, computed results (a Value Matrix and a Policy Matrix). The grid information is passed to the template in a variable called `grid` (with attributes such as `grid.n`, `grid.start`, `grid.goal`, `grid.dead`, and `grid.obstacles`), and the computed matrices are available in the variables `value_matrix` and `policy_matrix`.

Please follow these requirements carefully:

1. **Overall Structure:**
   - Use a proper HTML5 doctype and include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
   - In the `<head>` section, include a `<meta charset="UTF-8">` and a `<title>`.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Include CSS styles in the `<style>` tag within `<head>`.
   - Define styles for a table (using `border-collapse` and margin settings).
   - Define CSS classes for different cell types:
     - `.start` should have a green background.
     - `.goal` should have a red background.
     - `.dead` should have a blue background.
     - `.obstacle` should have a gray background.
   - All `<td>` elements should have a width and height of 50px, centered text, vertical centering, and a 1px solid border.

3. **Body Content:**
   - Display a heading for the application.
   - Include a form that uses POST to the `/` route, with an input for grid size (5–9). The form should include a label and an input field (with attributes like `min="5"` and `max="9"`) and a submit button with the text "Generate Grid".

4. **Displaying the Grid:**
   - If a `grid` variable exists (i.e., the grid has been generated), display the grid as a table.
   - Use nested for loops (`{% for i in range(grid.n) %}` and `{% for j in range(grid.n) %}`) to iterate over rows and columns.
   - Inside the inner loop, set a variable called `cell` as `(i, j)` using Jinja’s `{% set cell = (i, j) %}`.
   - Use conditional statements to check:
     - If `cell == grid.start`, assign the CSS class "start".
     - If `cell == grid.goal`, assign the CSS class "goal".
     - If `cell == grid.dead`, assign the CSS class "dead".
     - If `cell in grid.obstacles`, assign the CSS class "obstacle".
     - Otherwise, leave the cell empty.
   - After the table, include a form that POSTs to `/solve` with a button labeled "Show Results".

5. **Displaying the Computed Results:**
   - If both `value_matrix` and `policy_matrix` exist, display two sections:
     - One section with the heading "Computed Results" and a subheading "Value Matrix".
     - A table for the Value Matrix: iterate over rows and columns as before, setting `cell = (i, j)` for each cell.
     - Use an inline style for the `<td>` elements that sets the background color based on the cell type (green for start, red for goal, blue for dead, gray for obstacles, and white otherwise).
     - Display the value for that cell, rounding it to two decimal places.
     - Then, similarly, create a section with the heading "Policy Matrix" and display the policy for each cell in a table, again with the same background colors based on the cell type.
   
6. **Output Format:**
   - Output the complete HTML code wrapped in triple backticks and labeled as HTML so that it can be directly saved as `index.html`.

Please generate the complete, corrected `index.html` file following the above requirements.

# Reinforcement Learning Gridworld with Iterative Policy Evaluation

This project demonstrates a simple reinforcement learning (RL) gridworld application using Flask for the web interface. It computes the value function using iterative policy evaluation under a uniform random policy while excluding obstacle cells (whose values remain fixed at 0). The computed Value and Policy Matrices are then displayed on the web page along with the original grid (which retains its color coding).

This project is developed following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. Below is a detailed explanation of each step and how it applies to this project.

---

## 1. Business Understanding

**Objective:**  
- **Demonstrate RL Concepts:** The project aims to visually illustrate basic reinforcement learning concepts by evaluating a gridworld where each cell represents a state.
- **Interactive Learning:** Users can generate a grid of size between 5×5 and 9×9, where:
  - The start cell is fixed (displayed in green).
  - The goal cell (red) and dead cell (blue) are randomly chosen.
  - A specific number of obstacle cells (gray) are also randomly placed.
- **Value & Policy Computation:** Compute the value function via iterative policy evaluation and derive a greedy policy, thereby reinforcing the understanding of policy evaluation in RL.
- **Visualization:** All results (original grid, Value Matrix, and Policy Matrix) are displayed on the web page, making it easy for users to see the impact of state values and decisions.

**Benefits:**  
- Provides an educational tool for understanding RL.
- Bridges the gap between theory (iterative policy evaluation) and practice (interactive web interface).

---

## 2. Data Understanding

**Components:**  
- **States (Grid Cells):** Each cell in the grid is considered a state.
- **Special States:**
  - **Start Cell:** Fixed at (0,0) and highlighted in green.
  - **Goal Cell:** Randomly selected, shown in red; reaching it yields a reward of +20.
  - **Dead Cell:** Randomly selected, shown in blue; entering it yields a penalty of –20.
  - **Obstacle Cells:** Randomly placed (n-2 cells) and shown in gray; these cells are not updated during evaluation (their value remains 0).
- **Actions:** The agent can move in four directions: Up, Down, Left, Right.
- **Rewards:**
  - **Goal:** +20
  - **Dead:** –20
  - **Obstacle (if attempted to move into):** –1 penalty (and the agent remains in the same cell)
  - **Normal move:** A small step cost (–0.1)

**Characteristics:**  
- The grid is generated dynamically based on user input.
- The reward structure defines the agent’s behavior and is central to the evaluation process.

---

## 3. Data Preparation

**Steps Involved:**  
- **User Input Validation:**  
  - The application accepts a grid size (integer between 5 and 9) from the user via a web form.
- **Grid Generation:**  
  - The grid is constructed as an n×n matrix.
  - The start cell is fixed at (0,0).
  - The goal and dead cells are randomly chosen from the available positions.
  - Obstacle cells are selected such that there are exactly n–2 obstacles.
- **Session Storage:**  
  - The grid configuration (size, start, goal, dead, obstacles) is stored in a Flask session to be used later during the iterative policy evaluation and policy derivation steps.

**Purpose:**  
- To ensure that the gridworld is consistently and correctly set up for the reinforcement learning evaluation.

## 4. Modeling

**Approach:**  
- **Iterative Policy Evaluation:**  
  - The model computes the value function for each non-terminal and non-obstacle state using a fixed uniform random policy.
  - The value update for each state is given by:
    \[
    V(s) = \frac{1}{|A|} \sum_{a \in A} \left( R(s, a) + \gamma \, V(s') \right)
    \]
    where \( R(s, a) \) is the reward obtained after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \), \( \gamma \) is the discount factor, and \( s' \) is the resulting state.
  - Terminal states (goal and dead) have fixed values.
  - **Exclusion of Obstacles:**  
    - For any obstacle state, the value is not updated (remains 0).
- **Policy Derivation:**  
  - Once the value function converges, a greedy policy is derived by selecting the action with the highest expected return for each non-terminal, non-obstacle state.
  - Obstacle cells are marked with a special symbol (e.g., "#").

**Outcome:**  
- A **Value Matrix** that indicates the expected return for each state.
- A **Policy Matrix** that specifies the optimal action for each state based on the computed values.

---

## 5. Evaluation

**Methods:**  
- **Convergence Check:**  
  - The iterative policy evaluation continues until the maximum change (delta) across all state values falls below a small threshold (θ), ensuring stability.
- **Visual Inspection:**  
  - The Value Matrix and Policy Matrix are displayed directly on the web page.
  - Users can verify if the computed values and derived policy align with the expected behavior of the gridworld.
- **Exclusion Validation:**  
  - Obstacle cells are visually confirmed to retain a value of 0 and have their policy marked appropriately.

**Insights:**  
- Visual feedback allows users to understand how the value function and policy evolve.
- The design illustrates how state constraints (like obstacles) can be incorporated into RL models.

## 6. Deployment

**Deployment Details:**  
- **Web Application:**  
  - Built using Flask, the application runs locally (default on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).
  - Users interact with the system via a web browser.
- **Results Display:**  
  - The computed Value and Policy Matrices are rendered on the same web page that displays the original grid.
  - The original grid retains its color coding (green for start, red for goal, blue for dead, gray for obstacles), ensuring consistency in visualization.
- **Project Structure:**
- **app.py:** Contains Flask routes, grid generation logic, iterative policy evaluation, policy derivation, and result rendering.
- **templates/index.html:** The HTML template that displays the grid, the computed matrices, and provides the user interface.

---

## How to Run the Application

1. **Install Dependencies:**
 - Install Flask via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
 - Ensure Python 3 is installed (tkinter is no longer required as results are displayed on the web).

2. **Run the Application:**
 - Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
 - Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

3. **Usage:**
 - On the homepage, enter a grid size (between 5 and 9) and click "Generate Grid".
 - The generated grid will appear, showing the start, goal, dead, and obstacle cells.
 - Click "Show Results" to compute the Value and Policy Matrices. The results will be displayed below the grid on the same page.
