# CRISP-DM: A Step-by-Step Guide

CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is the most widely used analytics and data mining process model. It describes the typical life-cycle of a data science or data mining project, guiding teams from business understanding to actionable insights. Below is a detailed overview of each phase.

---

## 1. Business Understanding

**Goal:**  
Gain a clear understanding of the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, then translate this into a data mining problem definition.

**Typical Steps:**
- Determine business objectives and success criteria.
- Assess the current business situation (resources, constraints, risks).
- Define data mining goals that support the business objectives.
- Develop a project plan with milestones and deliverables.

**Key Questions:**
- What problem are we trying to solve?
- What would a successful solution look like?
- What constraints or risks must be considered?

## 2. Data Understanding

**Goal:**  
Collect initial data and get familiar with it to identify data quality problems, discover initial insights, or detect interesting subsets for hypothesis generation.

**Typical Steps:**
- Collect data from available sources.
- Describe data (format, quantity, value types).
- Explore data through statistics and visualization.
- Assess data quality and completeness.

**Key Activities:**
- Summarizing datasets (e.g., mean, median, distribution).
- Checking for missing or inconsistent values.
- Visualizing relationships between variables.

## 3. Data Preparation

**Goal:**  
Construct the final dataset from the initial raw data. Data preparation tasks are likely to be performed multiple times and not in any prescribed order.

**Typical Steps:**
- Select relevant data (attributes, records).
- Clean data (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
- Construct new variables/attributes (feature engineering).
- Integrate data from multiple sources.
- Format and transform data as required by modeling tools.

**Common Techniques:**
- Normalization, encoding categorical variables, outlier detection.
- Feature selection and extraction.

## 4. Modeling

**Goal:**  
Select and apply appropriate modeling techniques, and calibrate model parameters to optimal values.

**Typical Steps:**
- Select modeling algorithms suitable for the problem (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).
- Generate test/train splits or folds.
- Build and train models using prepared data.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
- Tune hyperparameters to improve performance.

**Key Considerations:**
- Each modeling technique may require different data formats or preprocessing.
- Model interpretability vs. performance trade-offs.

## 5. Evaluation

**Goal:**  
Assess the model(s) to ensure they meet the business objectives and are robust, reliable, and valid.

**Typical Steps:**
- Review evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, etc.).
- Validate results against business goals and constraints.
- Check for overfitting, bias, or leakage.
- Solicit feedback from stakeholders.

**Deliverables:**
- Evaluation report comparing model(s) performance.
- Decision on next steps: deploy, iterate, or revisit earlier steps.

---

## 6. Deployment

**Goal:**  
Make the project’s results available for use in the day-to-day business environment.

**Typical Steps:**
- Deploy model into production (e.g., web app, API, embedded system).
- Integrate outputs into business processes or reporting systems.
- Document process and findings for stakeholders.
- Plan monitoring and maintenance of the deployed solution.

**Key Points:**
- Deployment is not always technical—it could mean creating a presentation, report, or dashboard.
- Ongoing monitoring may be required to ensure model performance over time.

## CRISP-DM Cycle

Data mining is an iterative process. Insights from later stages (e.g., Evaluation or Deployment) may prompt a return to earlier phases (e.g., Business Understanding or Data Preparation) for further refinement.
